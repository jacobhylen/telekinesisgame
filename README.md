# EyeCandy
This is EyeCandy, a portable, browser based game that you control with only your eye movement. The game uses the webcam eye-tracking library WebGazer.js to estimate gaze location to imitate what telekinesis could feel like.

To play the game, clone the repository and open up `Menu/index.html`. 

It's required to start by calibrating the neural networks model to your face and surroundings, so start with the calibration level, grant the game access to your webcamera. Once you can see your face in the top left, follow the on-screen instructions, and enjoy!
